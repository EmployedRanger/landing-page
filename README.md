These images were taken from the original Naruto and Boruto animes produced by StudioPierrot and TV Tokyo based on Manga written y Masashki Kishimoto. All respective rightsbelongs to them. There is no commercial application for these images in this case, merely promoting the already well known story. 

This took way longer than I expected. It actually got easier when I decided to include real images instead of just putting in placeholders.
